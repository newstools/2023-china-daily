China will further its efforts to attract and utilize more foreign investment this year, as outlined in the Government Work Report submitted to the national legislature for deliberation on Sunday. Delivered by Premier Li Keqiang, the report outlined several measures to achieve this goal, including expanding market access, opening up the modern services sector, ensuring national treatment and improving services for foreign-funded companies, and facilitating the launch of large foreign-funded projects. China plans to take more actions to join high-standard economic and trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The country will steadily expand institutional opening-up by proactively adopting relevant rules, regulations and standards, said the report. These efforts prove again China's commitments to further integrate into the global economy and attract more foreign investment, said Bai Ming, deputy director of international market research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing.
