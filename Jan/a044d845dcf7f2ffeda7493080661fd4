President Xi Jinping congratulated Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on his inauguration as president of the Federative Republic of Brazil, saying that he is ready to work with Lula to take bilateral ties to a higher level. In a congratulatory message sent to Lula on Monday, Xi noted that China and Brazil are both major developing countries with global influence and important emerging markets. The two countries, which are comprehensive strategic partners, share broad common interests and shoulder common development responsibilities, he said. Xi said that since the two countries established diplomatic ties 48 years ago, China-Brazil relations have witnessed sustained and in-depth development, thanks to joint efforts of both sides. This increasingly mature and dynamic relationship has become a model of relations between major developing countries with rich content and broad prospects, he said. Noting that he attaches great value to the development of the China-Brazil comprehensive strategic partnership, Xi said he stands ready to work with Lula to continue to firmly support each other in taking a development path in line with their own national conditions and respect each other's core interests. He also expressed his willingness to lead and push the partnership to a higher level with Lula from a strategic and long-term perspective, in order to better benefit the two countries and their peoples. Vice-President Wang Qishan, who led a delegation to Brazil from Saturday to Monday as Xi's special envoy, attended Lula's inauguration ceremony in Brasilia, the capital. During their meeting, Wang conveyed Xi's congratulations and warm wishes to Lula as well as his invitation for Lula to visit China. While in Brazil, Wang also met with Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin and then-acting vice-president Hamilton Mourao.
