The Dajue Temple in Yixing, Jiangsu province, held a remembrance ceremony on Sunday for Hsing Yun, a renowned monk who passed away aged 95 in Taiwan on Feb 5. The mainland had formed a 38-member delegation at the invitation of Fo Guang Shan temple that Hsing Yun founded and presided over in Taiwan, but the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan shot down the proposed trip on "security concerns", saying the mainland was engaging in "political manipulation". Now everybody knows which side of the Taiwan Straits is politicizing things. Yes, it is the DPP that puts partisan interests over everything, creating obstacles in people's daily lives. After coming to power in 2016, they immediately tore apart the agreement with the mainland on maintaining direct flights, mail, and business ties. As a result, families were torn apart, communication hindered and normal business activities curbed. The DPP cares little, if not at all, about Taiwan people's lives or convenience. They only care about insisting on hatred against the motherland. They didn't even spare Hsing Yun, a monk born in Jiangsu province in 1927 who made major contributions to Taiwan society, by denying access to guests from the mainland. Hsing Yun traveled to Taiwan in 1949 to learn aiding skills there to help more people, but could not return because of the civil war. He devoted his life to promoting Buddhism and helping others, be they from the mainland, from Taiwan or wherever. He never forgot his Chinese identity. On every public occasion, he reminded everyone that the Taiwan people are Chinese people. He visited the mainland often, and his efforts are part of efforts toward national reunification.
