It is tragic and infuriating to learn that another shooting in the United States, this time at the Michigan State University on Monday, has left three people dead, and five others injured, including two Chinese students. How can the US let one tragedy after another keep snuffing out innocent lives, breaking the hearts of countless family members and well-wishers? The country that once boasted of freedom and human rights is unable to protect its citizens. Parents now have to worry about the safety of their children while at school. What could be more ridiculous? The country has actually become a slaughterhouse for maniacs and criminals with the active connivance of the Congress and strong support from the all-powerful National Rifle Association. As the right to gun ownership is a legal right enshrined in their constitution, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the US to ban guns completely. However, it could at least try to strengthen people's protection by introducing stricter gun control. Unfortunately, the Congress has rejected these proposals thanks to the tiresome and costly struggle between the Democrats and the Republicans. Expectedly, the US will see endless arguments between gun opponents and supporters, while innocent people, particularly unarmed children, keep losing their lives in senseless shootings. Clearly, the US is not a haven for common people, but an arena for the many interest groups. Ultimately, what can people expect from a government that is so obsessed with political fights that it overlooks the life and death of its common people? The endless shooting sprees in the US just expose the bloody scars of a so-called free US society. The author is a writer with China Daily.
