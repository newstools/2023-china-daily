If we want a sustainable, peaceful, prosperous world, we need to find a way to halt the global food crisis, said Arif Husain, chief economist at the UN World Food Programme. The number of those suffering from hunger at a crisis level has risen from 135 million to 345 million since 2019, before the pandemic began, Husain quoted the figures from the United Nations' World Food Programme. Husain added that less than 10 countries export 90 percent of total exports off crops. If any disruptions were to happen to one of these 10 countries, we would see a disproportionate effect around the world.
