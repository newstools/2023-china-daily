A father of a son who suffered a head trauma at birth decided to help his boy experience the world and enjoy life in a new fashion. Luo Shujian, 45, from Jinhua of Zhejiang province, finished the half-discipline race of the Shenzhen Marathon, pushing a three-wheeled trolley with his 13-year-old son in it on Sunday. Xiao Bai, Luo's son, has mental problems and epileptic fits after experiencing a severe neonatalÂ asphyxia at birth. But Luo and his wife have never given up taking care of their boy. Inspired by stories of marathon runners, Luo began to train in 2010, aiming to take part in races around the nation with his son. From the first race in 2015, Luo has taken his son to 56 events in more than 20 cities around the country. Luo works as a deliveryman in his home city and had a second child, a girl, in 2013.
