Zhuzhou Rubber Research & Design Institute Co Ltd, a Hunan-based subsidiary of State-owned China National Chemical Corp (Sinochem), has denied recent allegations that "it is involved in military production", said its parent group in an online statement. The company is a manufacturer of natural latex weather balloons for civilian use, and it is not involved in military production, said Sinochem. The products manufactured by the company are primarily used for daily weather forecasting at various meteorological stations. These weather balloons have no connection to any kind of airships spotted in the airspace of the United States, according to the statement.
